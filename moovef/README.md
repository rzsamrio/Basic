# Moove
Moove Africa plc is an uber partner that equips drivers with vehicles to join uber, thereby creating huge job opportunities.
They operate a drive-to-own system whereby drivers make daily remittances to own their given vehicles.

This program takes stats input from the user and creates an invoice for the user, telling him how much he is to remit and other details (Moove sends emails of invoices but not regularly) this program is designed to improve driver experience.

#### Changes
